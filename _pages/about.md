# About Me
I am a Ph.D. student in the School of Computing at National University of Singapore (NUS), jointly advised by [Prof. Bryan Hooi](http://bhooi.github.io/) and [Prof. Xavier Bresson](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=9pSK04MAAAAJ&hl=en). My research interests primary focus on deep learning on graphs.

Before joining NUS, I received my B.S. in the School of Computer Science at Fudan University, supervised by [Prof. Yang Chen](https://chenyang03.wordpress.com/).
