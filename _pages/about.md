# About Me
I am a Ph.D. student in the School of Computing at National University of Singapore (NUS), jointly advised by [Prof. Bryan Hooi](http://bhooi.github.io/) and [Prof. Xavier Bresson](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=9pSK04MAAAAJ&hl=en). Before joining NUS, I received my B.S. in the School of Computer Science at Fudan University.

My research interests primary focus on graph learning and large language models (LLMs). I am currently working on topics related to LLMs, such as Retrieval-Augmented Generation and multimodal (graph) reasoning. My research is supported by the [Google PhD Fellowship](https://research.google/programs-and-events/phd-fellowship/recipients/?filtertab=2024).
