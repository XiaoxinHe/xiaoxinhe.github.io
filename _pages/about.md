# üëã About Me
I am a second-year Ph.D. student in the School of Computing at National University of Singapore (NUS), jointly supervised by Prof. [Bryan Hooi](http://bhooi.github.io/) and Prof. [Xavier Bresson](https://graphdeeplearning.github.io/authors/xavier-bresson/). My research interests primary focus on deep learning on graphs.

Before joining NUS, I received my B.S. in the School of Computer Science at Fudan University, supervised by Prof. [Yang Chen](https://chenyang03.wordpress.com/).
